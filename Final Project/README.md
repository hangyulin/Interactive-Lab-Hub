## Deliverables

1. Documentation of design process
2. Archive of all code, design patterns, etc. used in the final design. (As with labs, the standard should be that the documentation would allow you to recreate your project if you woke up with amnesia.)
3. Video of someone using your project (or as safe a version of that as can be managed given social distancing)
4. Reflections on process (What have you learned or wish you knew at the start?)

# Cat and Mouse

We would like to introduce you to our Cat and Mouse game.

It is a two players game, where each player controls a square on the screen.

One player try to catch the other player, while the other player tries to run away for 120 seconds.

The two players can be anywhere in the world and be able to challenge each other on their Raspberry Pi.
