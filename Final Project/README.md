## Deliverables

1. Documentation of design process
2. Archive of all code, design patterns, etc. used in the final design. (As with labs, the standard should be that the documentation would allow you to recreate your project if you woke up with amnesia.)
3. Video of someone using your project (or as safe a version of that as can be managed given social distancing)
4. Reflections on process (What have you learned or wish you knew at the start?)
